# Piano App
Piano Application for Android

## Idea ##

This application will allow the user to use the touch screen of their android phone/tablet to control a virtual representation
of a piano. On hitting a key, the corresponding sound file is played. This application is intended to either be used by musicians
to quickly try out new ideas on the go, or by anyone 

Although many similar applications exist, they are often limited by the fact that touch screens on a lot of devices aren't
pressure-sensitive. Because of this, most piano applications sound somewhat lifeless because each note can only be played at a
single velocity. This application intends to solve this problem by adding a velocity slider that allows users to instantly alter
the velocity levels with which the keys are struck. This will allow users to play with more dynamic expressions 
than would normally be possible on touchscreens that lack pressure sensitivity.
